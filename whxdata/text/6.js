","Bieniawski"," (1973) πρότεινε μία ταξινό­μηση που συμπεριλάμβανε οκτώ παραμέτρους, που αργότερα (1976,1979), περιόρισε σε έξι: 1) την αντοχή σε μονοαξονική θλίψη του αδιατάρακτου υλικού πετρώματος, 2) το δείκτη ποιότητας πετρώματος (","R",".","Q",".","D",".), 3) την απόσταση μεταξύ των ασυνεχειών, 4) τον προσανατολισμό των ασυνε­χειών, 5) την κατάσταση των ασυνεχειών και 6) τη δίαιτα του υπόγειου νερού. Όλες αυτές οι παράμε­τροι ελέγχουν τη συμπεριφορά της ασυνεχούς βραχομάζας, αλλά μερικές απ' αυτές, π.χ. οι 2, 3 και 5 είναι σπουδαιότερες από τις άλλες. Σε κάθε παράμετρο δίδεται ένας βαθμός σπουδαιότητας και τελικά με βάση το σύνολο των βαθμών γίνεται διαχωρισμός της βραχομάζας σε πέντε κύριες κατηγορίες ποιότητας, (πολύ καλή, καλή, μέτρια, φτωχή, πολύ φτωχή). Για κάθε μία από τις κατηγο­ρίες αυτές γίνεται συσχετισμός με τη συνοχή (","c",") και τη γωνία εσωτερικής τριβής (Φ) της βραχομά­ζας καθώς επίσης ορίζεται και η σχέση μεταξύ ανυ­ποστήρικτου τμήματος ενός πρανούς ή μίας σήραγγας και του χρόνου διατήρησης σε σταθερή κατάσταση. Η ταξινόμηση και οι τιμές του ","c"," (συνοχή βραχομάζας) και Φ (γωνία τριβής βραχομάζας) μπορούν να χρησιμοποιη­θούν και στις μελέτες θεμελιώσεων και ευστάθειας πρανών των τεχνικών έργων."," ","Η γεωμηχανική ταξινόμηση Ζ. Τ. ","Bieniawski"," μπο­ρεί να εφαρμοστεί σε όλους τους τύπους πετρωμάτων, αλλά με ιδιαίτερη προσοχή σε κάθε τύπο πετρώματος. Λόγω της ευρείας χρήσης της μεθόδου αυτής αλλά και της σπουδαιότητάς της στον προσδιορισμό των μηχανικών ιδιοτήτων κάποιας εξεταζόμενης βραχομάζας, η μέθοδος αυτή παρουσιάζεται στην συνέχεια αναλυτικότερα."," ","Ο προσδιορισμός των βραχομηχανικών ιδιοτήτων και παραμέτρων μπορεί να επιτευχθεί με βάση το σύστημα της Γεωμηχανικής ταξι­νόμησης της βραχομάζας ενός εξεταζόμενου πετρώματος ή δηλαδή με βάση την βαθμονόμηση R.M.R. (Rock Mass Rating) όπως προτάθηκε από τον Ζ.Τ. Bieniawski (1979, βελτιωμένη) και προσαρμόστηκε στην συνέχεια για τις περιπτώσεις όπου μελετώνται βραχώδη πρανή σύμφωνα με το σύστημα S.M.R. (Slope Mass Rating) όπως προτάθηκε από τον Romana (1985), όπως αναλυτικά τα δύο αυτά συστήματα παρουσιάζονται στην συνέχεια. Το σύστημα του Ζ.Τ. Bieniawski (1979, βελτιωμένη) απαιτεί τον εργαστηριακό προσδιορι­σμό της αντοχής σε μονοαξονική θλίψη του ακέ­ραιου υλικού πετρώματος, καθώς και άλλων πέντε παραμέ­τρων που προσδιορίζονται κατά την διατρητική ή επιφανειακή έρευνα του πετρώματος, όπως περιγράφονται στους ακόλουθους πίνακες. "," ","Στους ακόλουθους πίνακες 15, έως 22, παρουσιάζεται το σύστημα της Γεωμηχανικής ταξι­νόμησης της βραχομάζας ενός εξεταζόμενου πετρώματος κυρίως για πρανή εκσκαφών, με την βαθμονόμηση R.M.R. (Rock Mass Rating) όπως προτάθηκε από τον Ζ.Τ. Bieniawski (1979, βελτιωμένη) και προσαρμόστηκε στην συνέχεια για βραχώδη πρανή σύμφωνα με το σύστημα S.M.R.
